AIM:
To design and implement a Library Management System database using appropriate tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, and to perform DML operations along with DCL commands such as role creation, privilege granting, and revoking to ensure database security.


Software Requirements
●	Database Management System:

○	PostgreSQL

●	Database Administration Tool:

○	pgAdmin

Objective :
To gain practical experience in implementing Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL) operations in a real database environment. This will also include implementing role-based privileges to secure data.






Problem Statement
1.	A Library wants to develop a Library Management System database to manage information about books, members, and book issue records efficiently. The database should be designed using appropriate tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.

2.	The system must support basic database operations such as inserting records, updating existing data, and deleting obsolete entries. To ensure database security.

3.	To ensure database security, a database role named Librarian must be created. This role should be password protected and granted SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE permissions on the required tables. The system administrator (pgAdmin) should also have the ability to revoke these permissions when required using role-based access control.




As per the experiment requirment, their are two .sql files, 

->admin.sql         deplicts the DataBase Administerator or pg_admin

->librarian.sql     deplicts the user created role under pg_admin
